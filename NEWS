# RCite release history

## Versioning Scheme

RCite uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org). Version numbers are
determined as follows:

1. Patch version increases (x.x.up) indicate bug fixes. They are always
   backwards compatible and should only improve things.
2. Minor version increases (x.up.x) indicate feature additions and larger
   changes to the code. The user API (see below) remains backwards compatible,
   while the programmer API may change.
3. Major version increases (up.x.x) indicate fundamental changes to RCite.
   Both user and programmer API may change.

Major changes to both APIs are indicated below for each version.

### User And Programmer API

Everything that is meant to be used in user-made styles belongs to the
user API. The StyleGuide is a good source: Everything mentioned there
is likely part of the user API. The same obviously applies to the `rcite`
command itself. Use `rake api` to display a complete list.

All the other public classes and methods belong to the programmer API.
