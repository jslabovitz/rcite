# RCite

## Synopsis

RCite is a tiny tool that can be used to generate citations and
bibliography entries based on parameterized literature descriptions in
the spirit of [BibTeX](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX),
[BibLaTeX](http://mirror.its.uidaho.edu/pub/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/biblatex.html)
and [CSL](http://citationstyles.org/).

## Why RCite?

The existing solutions mentioned above all have one flaw in common: It is
utterly cumbersome to create or edit styles. BibTeX style syntax is extremely
hard to learn; BibLaTeX suffers from the fact that LaTeX itself is something
of a hybrid between programming and markup language; and CSL uses XML to create
styles in a not very intuitive manner.

RCite attempts to avoid this flaw by making styles pure Ruby. Given its
simplicity and human-readability, Ruby is almost ideal for this purpose:
Beginners can use builtin methods to chain strings together, while experts
can command its full power to create complex styles.

## Installation

### ...as a Gem

    $ gem install rcite

### ...manually

    $ git clone git://github.com/JLimperg/rcite.git
    $ cd rcite
    $ bundle install

## Command Line Usage

The `rcite` command provides a (very) basic interface to RCite. It can be
used as follows:

    rcite [bib|cite] key --style=stylefile --bib=bibfile

    bib
      Causes the programme to generate a bibliography entry for the specified
      text, as opposed to a citation.
    cite
      Causes the programme to generate a citation for the specified
      text, as opposed to a bibliography entry.

    key
      The text's id, which is the unique identifier given in the bibfile.

    stylefile
      An RCite style. For instructions on how to make a style, see below.
    bibfile
      A BibTeX file containing bibliographic data about the texts you want
      to cite.

## Creating and Editing Styles

See the [Style Guide](StyleGuide).

## Contributing

Please do! I'm actually pretty much of a Ruby noob so don't hesitate to fix
my mistakes. ;) RCite is at the moment lacking quite a number of major
features which can partly be found in the issue tracker on Github.

Please take care, though, that your pull request/patch does not break the
spec examples and that it is itself thoroughly spec'ed and documented. I am
going for 100% code and documentation coverage, therefore it'd be cool if you
could do so as well.
