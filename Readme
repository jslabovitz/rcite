# RCite

## Functionality

In case it is ever finished, RCite will be a tool to generate citations and
bibliography entries based on parameterized literature descriptions in
the spirit of BibTeX, BibLaTeX and CSL.

## Why RCite?

The existing solutions (as listed above) all have one flaw in common: It is
utterly cumbersome to create or edit styles. BibTeX style syntax is extremely
hard to learn; BibLaTeX suffers from the fact that LaTeX itself is something
of a hybrid between programming and markup language, and CSL uses XML as a
basis.

RCite attempts to circumvent this flaw by making styles pure Ruby. Given its
simplicity and human-readability, Ruby is almost ideal for this purpose:
Beginners can use builtin methods to chain strings together, while experts
can use its full power to create complex styles. RCite essentially aims to
provide a parser for literature databases, a nice set of helper methods
to ease style creation and a processor that applies styles to the databases.

## Input

Currently, only support for BibTeX is planned via the bibtex-ruby gem.
Parsers for other literature databases may be added at a later point.
