module RCite

  # The `Processor` class is responsible for chaining the two steps involved
  # in creating a citation or bibliography together:
  #
  # 1. Load a (BibTeX) file with bibliographic information about all the texts.
  # 2. Load a style that defines how to construct citations and bibliography
  #    entries from the former.
  # 
  # Moreover, it provides shortcuts for citing and bibliography entry creation
  # by mapping {RCite::Style#cite} and {RCite::Style#bib}.
  #
  # @todo Implement the shortcuts.

    # The style that is used to turn bibliographic data gathered from a
    # (BibTeX) file to actual citations/bibliographic entries. Should

    # has been loaded yet.

    # `another_style.rb` must define `RCite::AnotherStyle`.

    # in it is assigned to {#style}.
