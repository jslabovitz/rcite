module RCite
  module CLI
    # Represents an RCite command. RCite uses the same structure for its CLI
    # as `gem`, `git` etc., i.e. it has multiple commands that correspond to
    # various actions. For example, `rcite cite` will cite a text, while
    # `rcite bib` will create a bibliography entry.
    #
    # This class provides helper methods that establish a framework for
    # individual commands. Each of those has its own class that is a child of
    # this class.
    #
    # Child classes are expected to implement the following methods:
    #
    # - ::name -- Returns the command's name. See class method {::name}.
    # - #setup_slop -- Creates a new `Slop` instance and defines the options
    #   that may be used with the command. Sets the `@slop` instance variable
    #   accordingly.
    # - #run! -- Runs the command after all options have been parsed and their
    #   validity has been checked.
    #
    # @abstract
    class Command

      require 'slop'

      # @return [String] the command's name. This is used to identify the
      #   command the user is calling. For example, RCite will search for
      #   a command with name 'cite' when called as `rcite cite`. Individual
      #   commands must override this variable.
