# Top-level module for the RCite application/library.
module RCite
  # Ancestor class for all user-defined styles. This class defines a unified
  # interface for styles (namely the {#cite} and {#bib} method) as well
  # as providing various helper methods to ease creating new styles.
  #
  # The 'workflow' of the Style class goes as follows:
  #
  # 1. {#cite} or {#bib} are called with a BibTeX::Entry for the text that
  #    is to be cited. They check if their style object has a
  #    `cite_type` and `bib_type` method respectively, where `type` is the
  #    BibTeX entry type for the current text. If so, they set {#text}
  #    accordingly and reset {#elements}.
  # 2. The `cite_type` and `bib_type` methods use {#add} to add
  #    {RCite::Element}s to {#elements}.
  # 3. When these methods return, the actual citation/bibliography entry
  #    is constructed from {#elements}.
  class Style

    # A BibTeX::Entry that describes the text currently being processed. Should
    # not be changed by any methods except {#cite} and {#bib}. See {Style} for

    # @return [BibTeX::Entry] The current text's entry.

    #   user wants to cite.
