    #
    # 1. which command to call -- cite or bib
    # 2. the BibTeX key of the text to be cited/bib'd
    # 3. the page that should be cited (optional)
    # 4. additional fields as a YAML inline hash (optional)
    #
    # In other words, the syntax is:
    #
    # ```
    # command   ::== cite|bib key [page] [hash[, hash]*]
    # key       ::== anything_but_whitespace+
    # page      ::== anything_but_whitespace+

    # hash_val  ::== anything_but_comma*
